# Atem Tally Project

This is a project that connects to a Black Magic Design (BMD) Atem switcher and sends tally information over TCP on port 59090. This information can then be picked up by any device on the network setup to listen to the ip and port. Some example files will be included and can be used out of the box. Example files will cover M5Stick-C and a relay board with ethernet module that can be found here.
